# Introduction

A DAO is introduced to govern the management of the LSD project that based on StaFi LSD Stack, it is not mandatory, this option is used to guide how to decentralize the project. The StaFi LSD Stack DAO has responsibility to deploy, manage, upgrade, maintain contracts and services, the more transparence of the DAO, the more of the decentralize of the StaFi LSD Stack based projects.

## An example to explain details

ETH LSD Stack DAO( a subDAO of the StaFi LSD Stack DAO, or share the same members of the Stack DAO ) is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization that determines the key parameters of ETH LSD Stack based protocols through the voting power of governance token. There are numerous day-to-day decisions required for maintaining the ETH LSD Stack protocol. It is crucial for the community to not only understand these decisions but also participate in the decision-making process. The community will benefit from the DAO due to its transparency, security, and participatory management approach.

## Responsibility

- **Assets Management:** The DAO oversees the management and allocation of assets within the ETH LSD Stack ecosystem. This includes monitoring asset distribution, ensuring liquidity, and making strategic decisions about asset utilization to support the growth and stability of the protocol.
- **Protocol Fee Management:** It is responsible for determining and adjusting the fees associated with the use of the ETH LSD Stack protocol. This includes setting transaction fees, service charges, and any other fees that might be applicable. The DAO ensures that these fees are balanced to maintain the protocol's competitiveness while supporting its sustainability.
- **Parameters of Protocol Contract Management:** The DAO plays a pivotal role in managing the parameters of the protocol's smart contracts. This involves setting and updating rules, conditions, and other operational parameters that dictate how the contracts function. It requires a deep understanding of the protocol's technical and operational aspects to ensure optimal performance and security.
- **Contract Upgradeability:** The DAO is entrusted with overseeing the upgradeability of contracts. This  deciding when and how smart contracts should be upgraded, ensuring they remain secure, efficient, and aligned with the evolving needs of the ETH LSD Stack ecosystem.
- **Entrusted Voters Management:** Entrusted voters consist of individuals or organizations renowned within the Web3 industry. Despite their prominence, it remains crucial for the community to actively participate in deciding who gets added to or removed from this group. This approach marks a significant advancement, shifting power to the community rather than concentrating it in the hands of a single entity or centralized organization.

## Timelock logic

> One man's meat is another man's poison

StaFi LSD Stack DAO empowers community members to participate the decision-making process through their voting power. In reality, it's challenging to find decisions that satisfy everyone's needs. We're thrilled to announce the implementation of Timelock logic into our system. This feature reduces the impact of the minorities. Rather than simply accepting a proposal, members who disagree now have options to act before the proposal takes effect.

## Data Availability Guarantee

Due to the limitations of the Ethereum blockchain, synchronizing data from the Consensus chain to the Execution chain necessitates the use of a relay service. Since a relay service operates off-chain, it presents specific challenges that need to be addressed to ensure reliability and data integrity:

- **Single Point of Failure**: Relying on a single relay service can lead to vulnerabilities, as the entire system's functionality will not work properly if this service fails. Deploying multiple relay services is a clear solution to the issue.
- **Data Correctness**: Ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the data being relayed is paramount. To address this, we propose implementing a voting power system. This system will only accept data that has achieved consensus among a majority of participants. In other words, data will be deemed valid and integrated into the Execution chain only if most participants have agreed on its accuracy and correctness.

This approach not only enhances the robustness of the data syncing process but also aligns with the decentralized ethos of blockchain technology. By leveraging the collective agreement of network participants, we can significantly reduce the risks associated with data relay and ensure a higher degree of trust and transparency in the process.
