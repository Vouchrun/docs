# VOUCH Token

## What is the VOUCH token

Phase 2 of the Vouch Ecosystem deployment introduces the VOUCH token. VOUCH token is the Vouch protocol's future governance token, and gives power to the community in determining; 1) the path of the protocol 2) setting any configurable parameters. In addtion to governace rights, the VOUCH token seeks to capture value generated in the protocol and fuel growth of the ecosystem by:
- Funding additional Vouch Community Validators (which stream more PLS into the ecosystem)
- Bolster Liquidity of both vPLS and VOUCH token in various LP pools
- Provide a secondary PLS stream for the [Vouch Ecosystem](/docs/introduction/Vouch_Ecosystem.html) in the way of token fees.

## Goals of the VOUCH token

- Allow Holders to Govern Protocol via a DAO (phase 3)
- Wide distribution to a solid community group
- Encourage involvement from Community Members
- Generate PLS for Community Validators and Protocol Growth
- Reward Participants with Staking Rewards (phase 3)
- Encourage Protocol use and adoption by:
  - Helping onboard Validators by providing increased yield
  - Incentive Align vPLS stakers, Validators, VOUCH holders and the Vouch Team.
