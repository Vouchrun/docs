</div>

## The Lowdown

Vouch is evolving from a "simple" Liquid Staking Protocol, and morphing into The Vouch Ecosystem. This introduces a secondary token called VOUCH and some sophisticated token mechanics which will help fuel the growth of the system for all participants.

This represents a major upgrade to the Vouch system which has been many months in the works. The Vouch website, staking and validator apps have been given a new coat of paint and new features have been added, make sure you check out the new dashboard located in both the [Staking App](https://app.vouch.run/dashboard) and the [Validators App](https://val.vouch.run/dashboard)

For more detailed information see [Ecosystem Docs](https://vouch.run/docs/vouch_ecosystem/Ecosystem_Overview.html) or check out [this interview with Jexxa.](https://youtu.be/4NxY_0NzaFQ?si=pbwygGjcBc2Iy-Fb)

## Launch Details

**Wen Launch:**

Expected launch will be in the coming days, 24hrs notice will be provided prior, and at go time all social channels will be informed. Launch is planned to be on Tuesday 26th August 00:00 UTC (no promises or expectations).

**How:**

VOUCH and the associated contracts have already been deployed on pulsechain mainnet. Airdrops have commenced and the initial LP Pools will be seeded, HOWEVER:

:::info **Sniper Protection** is built into the token contract so transfer and trading is not currently active.
:::
- Once the token contract's launch function has been called trading and transfers will be active.
- Anti-sniper bot protection will remain active for 10mins after launch, reducing the capacity for bots to grab excess supply prior to humans.
- Per Transaction Trading Limits will be gradually increased over the first hour to ensure a smoother distribution of the tokens allocated to the liquidity pools.
     - Initial Phase (0-10 minutes): 0.1% of total supply (100,000,000 tokens) per transaction.
     - Intermediate Phase (10-70 minutes): 0.5% of total supply (500,000,000 tokens) per transaction.
     - Final Phase (70 minutes onwards): 100% of total supply (100,000,000,000 tokens) per transaction, effectively removing all limits.

**Token Dynamics:**
- VOUCH is deflationary with a starting (Max) supply of 100,000,000,000 VOUCH
- Buy, Sell & Transfer fees are set to 5% on the token, revenue from token is injected into the ecosystem. (see above links for more details)
- Airdrops for Vouch Staking Protocol supporters are currently underway with some already issued, this aligns all system participants moving forward.
- VOUCH captures value in the ecosystem and has the potential to facilitate governance in the future.
