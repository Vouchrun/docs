# Pulse-staking-deposit-cli Guide

## Using deposit-cli to generate key files

Before you can participate as a Solo or Trusted Validator on the Vouch protocol, you need to generate the requried keystores and deposit files, much like you would if you were operating a "normal" validator on the Pulsechain network. 

`pulse-staking-deposit-cli` is a tool for creating EIP-2335 format BLS12-381 keystores and a corresponding `deposit_data-*.json` file and `stake_data-*.json` file for use with the Vouch Protocol. This tool creates deposit files that are compatable with the Ethereum and Pulsechain Launchpads, however the output files are designed to be used exclusivly with the Vouch Protocol. 

:warning: Do not use the generated deposit file with the offical Pulschain Launchpad site.


## Installing pulse-staking-deposit-cli

:::warning 
Please generate your keystores on your own safe, completely offline device, and backup your mnemonic, keystores, and password securely.

Withdrawal Address set to the Vouch `Network_Withdraw` contract address

Node Prority Fee Address set to the Vouch `Fee_Pool` contract address

***Using the tool on an offline and secure device is highly recommended to keep your mnemonic safe.***

Please enter your mnemonic separated by spaces (" "). Note: you only need to enter the first 4 letters of each word if you'd prefer.: abuse april random flash service typical uncover ginger pupil social angle slot siren tool blush dinner they also camp pen school deal review album
Enter the index (key number) you wish to start generating more keys from. For example, if you've generated 4 keys in the past, you'd enter 4 here. [0]:
Please repeat the index to confirm: 0
Please choose how many new validators you wish to run: 3
Please enter the amount that a validator must deposit (type 0 for trust node, solo nodes need such as 4000000, 8000000 or 12000000 etc, you can find it in the doc): 12000000 --hel
Please enter withdrawal recipient address: 0x99F7C7c951dEF272ee5638eA7Cc731b1f09B12e0

you are setting 0x99F7C7c951dEF272ee5638eA7Cc731b1f09B12e0 as your withdrawal address

Repeat your withdrawal recipient address for confirmation: 0x99F7C7c951dEF272ee5638eA7Cc731b1f09B12e0

you are setting 0x99F7C7c951dEF272ee5638eA7Cc731b1f09B12e0 as your withdrawal address

Please choose the (mainnet or testnet) network/chain name ['mainnet', 'goerli', 'sepolia', 'zhejiang', 'pulsechain', 'pulsechain-devnet', 'pulsechain-testnet-v4']:  [mainnet]: pulsechain-testnet-v4
Create a password that secures your validator keystore(s). You will need to re-enter this to decrypt them when you setup your Ethereum validators.:

If you are a solo validator, please configure your fee recipient as 0x6fb2aa2443564d9430b9483b1a5eea13a522df45.

If you are a trust validator, please configure your fee recipient as 0xdc5a28885a1800b1435982954ee9b51d2a8d3bf0.

Otherwise you will be slashed by StaFi protocol. More details about the configuration, you can check here.

It may take hours or days for your validator to become fully activated. To learn more about the validator activation process, see Deposit Process. See Check node and validator status for detailed status monitoring guidance. In the meantime, leave your execution client, beacon node, and validator client terminal windows open and running; once your validator is activated, it will automatically begin proposing and validating blocks.

To check on the status of your validator, we recommend checking out the popular block explorers: beaconcha.in by Bitfly and beaconscan.com by the Etherscan team.
